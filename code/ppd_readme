 Design Choice
 	- Vending Machine only accepts maximum of 30 different items. (Natural to 
 	have limited space)
 	
 	- When reading in the stock file it will ignore empty lines. Some OS's may
 	create empty lines which the Vending Machine can handle. When writing back 
 	the to the file the Vending Machine will rectify that problem and remove
 	them.
 	
 	- All stock must begin with an "I". Any stock that does not start with an "I"
 	will be considered an error and vending machine will need a service.
 	
 	- Coin file can only accept 8 unique lines (empty lines are ignored) that
 	match the Vending Machines enum. Any duplicates or missing coins will be 
 	regarded as invalid. Even if coins have run out the coin file save the hand
 	as 0. This should indicate to the system admin that the coins need to be 
 	restocked.
 	
 	- The machine can only accept a maximum of 10 coins per transaction. 
 	If user exceeds this limit the transaction is cancelled and money is 
 	returned to the user.
 	
 	- When adding a new item, It will find the next available item ID. For 
 	Example If I0002 was removed it will make sure it will find that ID and 
 	use it. With this setup in place it will be impossible to render an ID 
 	redundant.
 	
 	- Add item: When inputing a price, It only accepts correct format DD.CC also
 	the cents needs to be of modular of 5.
 	
 	- If there is not enough money in the vending machine to return change
 	the transaction will be canceled and a refund will be offered.
 	
Summary
	- While reading over my code I discovered ways that I could have improved 
	it, especially during the validation period. It became apparent that if 
	there was an efficient planning process in place from the beginning I could 
	have utilised more generic functions that would have shortened my code.
 	
Future functionality
	- Implementation of a notification system. When reaching to 95% stock level to
	notify the administrator that they are running low on space and should not
	add more items to the Vending Machine.
	
	- The implementation of a feature in which the administrator would be 
	notified when stock or coin levels reach 5% would be an integral part of 
	the success of the vending machine.
